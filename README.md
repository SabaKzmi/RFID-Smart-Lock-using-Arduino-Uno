# RFID Smart Lock using Arduino Uno
This Arduino project implements a smart lock system using an RFID reader (MFRC522). When a registered RFID card is scanned, the lock is activated and an LED indicates access granted.
If the card is unrecognized, access is denied, and a different LED indicates the failure.
